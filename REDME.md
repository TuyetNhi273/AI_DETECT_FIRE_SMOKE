# Code Model

This repository contains code for a basic code model, which is a deep learning model that is trained on source code. The model is based on the [Codeium Code Model](https://github.com/codeium/codeium-code-model) and is designed to be used for code completion, code search, and code generation tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code model, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- The [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library
- The [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) library

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can download the pre-trained model weights from the [Codeium Code Model](https://github.com/codeium/codeium-code-model) repository.

## Usage

To use the code model, you will need to import the `CodeModel` class from the `code_model` module and create an instance of the class. You can then use the instance to make predictions on source code.

For example, to use the code model to complete a partial code snippet, you can use the following code:
